<h2>Welcome</h2>

The Robotics & Autonomous Systems Competence Center is part of Senai Cimatec, a large technology institution in the Northeast of Brazil.</br>
Led by Marco Reis, the members of this center develop robotic systems to be used in complex tasks on land, underwater and in the air (at some future point in space as well).</br>

<br>
RASC promotes motivation in the development of young scientists to work in Senai Cimatec's technological projects and has stood out as an exponent in the country.</br>
